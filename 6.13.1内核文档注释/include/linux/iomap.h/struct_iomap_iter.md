```C
/**
 * struct iomap_iter - Iterate through a range of a file
 * @inode: Set at the start of the iteration and should not change.
 * @pos: The current file position we are operating on.  It is updated by
 *	calls to iomap_iter().  Treat as read-only in the body.
 * @len: The remaining length of the file segment we're operating on.
 *	It is updated at the same time as @pos.
 * @processed: The number of bytes processed by the body in the most recent
 *	iteration, or a negative errno. 0 causes the iteration to stop.
 * @flags: Zero or more of the iomap_begin flags above.
 * @iomap: Map describing the I/O iteration
 * @srcmap: Source map for COW operations
