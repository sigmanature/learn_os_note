```C
/**
 * page_cache_sync_readahead - generic file readahead
 * @mapping: address_space which holds the pagecache and I/O vectors
 * @ra: file_ra_state which holds the readahead state
 * @file: Used by the filesystem for authentication.
 * @index: Index of first page to be read.
 * @req_count: Total number of pages being read by the caller.
 *
 * page_cache_sync_readahead() should be called when a cache miss happened:
 * it will submit the read.  The readahead logic may decide to piggyback more
 * pages onto the read request if access patterns suggest it will improve
 * performance.
